* About
 This is my Emacs init file(s) to achieve cross-platform use of my Emacs. Although nothing innovative, I'm happy if my configuration can help you. Happy Emacs!
* Structure
I divide my init files into several different elisp files and use init.el to call them.
The structure is like:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
  +-- ~/.emacs.d
     +-- init.el
     +-- lisp folder
         +-- init-*.el
#+END_SRC
