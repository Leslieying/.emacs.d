* About
 This is my emacs init file(s), I'm very happy if my configuration can help you. Happy Emacs!
* Structure
I divide my init files into several different elisp files and use init.el to call them.
The concret structure is:
#+BEGIN_SRC text
+-- ~/.emacs.d
   +-- init.el
   +-- config
       +-- basic-config.el ;; configs about color theme, editor setting etc.
       +-- package-configs.el ;; use-package configs
#+END_SRC
